Bought 80 qty of BANKNIFTY27200PE  @ 64.5 Position = 5160
Bought 40 qty of BANKNIFTY27300CE  @ 108  Position = 4320

LTP of BANKNIFTY27200PE = 357  Position would've worth 14280

# CAUSES (Got out too early)


LEssons:-   + INR weakened (Was natural)
            _ Before expiry even though contract is in the money prices will decrease
                Major momentum can only incease it..

            + Directional movements can cause option prices to fluctuate like hell.............


Current CASH 23000;



# will never lose an opportunity again...
